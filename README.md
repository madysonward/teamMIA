# TeamMIA

This project was created by Madyson (`https://github.com/madysonward/`), AJ (`https://github.com/ahephner/`), and Isaac (`https://github.com/iludlow99`) for our @Work team project.

## Getting Started

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running the Tests

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Deployment

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Built With

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
